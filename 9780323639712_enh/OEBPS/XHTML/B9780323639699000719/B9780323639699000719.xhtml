<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0015">
<a id="o0530"></a>1. PE is a common sexual dysfunction.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0020">
<a id="o0535"></a>2. PE is associated with negative psychological consequences including distress, bother, and frustration, which may affect quality of life, partner relationships, self-esteem, self-confidence, and can act as an obstacle to single men forming new partner relationships.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0025">
<a id="o0540"></a>3. The evidence-based ISSM definition of lifelong and acquired PE should form the basis of the office diagnosis of lifelong PE.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0030">
<a id="o0545"></a>4. There is limited evidence suggesting that lifelong PE has a genetic basis and acquired PE is most often due to sexual performance anxiety, psychological or relationship problems, and/or ED.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0035">
<a id="o0550"></a>5. Oral SSRI drugs and topical anesthetic drugs are effective and safe treatments for PE.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0040">
<a id="o0555"></a>6. Psychosexual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has a limited role as a first-line treatment for PE but has an important role as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, especially in men with acquired PE due to sexual performance anxiety.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0045">
<a id="o0560"></a>7. Men with acquired PE most secondary to co-morbid ED, hyperthyroidism, chronic lower urogenital infection, prostatodynia, or chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) should receive appropriate etiology-specific treatment alone or in combination with an SSRI.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0050">
<a id="o0565"></a>8. The causes of DE and anejaculation are manifold.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0055">
<a id="o0570"></a>9. Failure of ejaculation can be a lifelong problem (25%) or an acquired problem (75%). It may be global and occur in every sexual encounter or be intermittent or situational.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0060">
<a id="o0575"></a>10. Treatment of men with DE should be etiology-specific and address the issue of infertility in men of reproductive age.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0065">
<a id="o0580"></a>11. Drug treatment of men with DE or anejaculation has limited success..</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0070">
<a id="o0585"></a>12. TURP and diabetic autonomic neuropathy are the most common causes of retrograde ejaculation.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0075">
<a id="o0590"></a>13. RE and failure of emission can be distinguished by examination of a post masturbatory specimen of urine for the presence of spermatozoa and fructose.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0080">
<a id="o0595"></a>14. Pharmacotherapy is associated with variable degrees of success and includes agents such as pseudoephedrine, midodrine, and imipramine.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0085">
<a id="o0600"></a>15. The symptoms of post-orgasmic illness syndrome (POIS) occur following ejaculation and comprise severe myalgia, fatigue associated with a flu-like state, nasal congestion, and itching eyes.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0090">
<a id="o0605"></a>16. POIS symptoms commence within 30 minutes of ejaculation in 87% of men and increase in intensity to a peak on day 2.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0095">
<a id="o0610"></a>17. A type 1 hypersensitivity immunogenic reaction has been proposed as the underlying mechanism.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0100">
<a id="o0615"></a>18. A prolonged hyposensitization program with multiple subcutaneous injections of autologous semen has been suggested as a possible treatment.</li>
