<a id="o0710"></a>1. Constipation may cause significant voiding dysfunction.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0020">
<a id="o0715"></a>2. Functional constipation is a diagnosis of exclusion.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0025">
<a id="o0720"></a>3. Organic conditions associated with elimination problems include cystic fibrosis, hypothyroidism, celiac disease, dietary allergies, Hirschsprung disease, anal stenosis, and trisomy 21. In the older child, mental health issues, eating disorders, sexual abuse, and irritable bowel syndrome should also be considered.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0030">
<a id="o0725"></a>4. Initial medical management includes behavioral modification (regular defecation and nonsedentary activity), dietary changes (fluid and fiber intake), stool softeners and laxatives, and judicious use of enemas.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0035">
<a id="o0730"></a>5. Antegrade continence enemas may be given through the cecum or left colon. It often requires that the child sit on the toilet for up to an hour before emptying is complete. The procedure is best employed in children 5–12 years of age who are motivated and is more successful in patients with neuropathic bowel or anorectal malformations.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0040">
<a id="o0735"></a>6. Impaction should be suspected when a mass is felt in the lower abdomen and/or left lower quadrant, or a dilated rectum filled with a large amount of stool is seen on pelvic ultrasound or abdominal radiography.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0045">
<a id="o0740"></a>7. In patients with fecal impaction, the addition of fiber to the diet is bound to worsen the problem by increasing fecal load and is generally avoided during the initial management.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0050">
<a id="o0745"></a>8. The age of onset of symptoms is one of the easiest and most important pieces of information to obtain because it can be an important indicator for underlying pathology, particularly if it has been present since early in life (infancy).</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0055">
<a id="o0750"></a>9. Endocrine disorders associated with chronic dehydration (such as diabetes insipidus), electrolyte disorders (most notably hypercalcemia and hypokalemia), hypothyroidism, and hypervitaminosis D are important potential organic etiologies.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0060">
<a id="o0755"></a>10. Although of modest clinical value, abdominal radiographs are commonly employed in the diagnosis and management of constipation. Proponents of routine use argue that the study can clearly demonstrate the amount of fecal loading and delineate stool distribution throughout the colon and rectum, as well as help ascertain the presence of fecal impaction. In addition, it may also reveal associated pathologies, such as bony abnormalities indicative of occult spinal dysraphism or sacral agenesis.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0065">
<a id="o0760"></a>11. Polyethylene glycol is better tolerated and easier to administer than alternative medications such as lactulose, mineral oil, and milk of magnesia.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0070">
<a id="o0765"></a>12. The most common problem with antegrade continence enemas is pain or discomfort during instillation. In the majority of patients, this is a transient phenomenon that subsides during the first 3 months. It is always important to ensure that the pain is not due to distal fecal impaction.</li>
