<ul class="ce_list" id="olist0165">
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0015">
<a id="o0955"></a>1. When exposed to STIs, women are more likely to become infected and less likely to be symptomatic.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0020">
<a id="o0960"></a>2. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0025">
<a id="o0965"></a>3. HSV-2 accounts for 90% of the genital herpes infections. HSV-1 accounts for the remainder and is the common cause of cold sores; silent infection is common in this disease. The diagnosis is made by viral culture and subtyping. HSV enters the nerve and remains latent in the nerve cell body. It may cause aseptic meningitis and autonomic dysfunction, which may lead to urinary retention.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0030">
<a id="o0970"></a>4. Chancroid is caused by <span class="italic">Haemophilus ducreyi</span> and results in a painful, nonindurated ulcer covered by an exudate. Inguinal adenopathy occurs and may become suppurative.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0035">
<a id="o0975"></a>5. Chancre of syphilis is single, painless, indurated, and clean. It is associated with nontender inguinal lymphadenopathy.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0040">
<a id="o0980"></a>6. Latent syphilis is seropositive with no evidence of disease. Early latent syphilis occurs in less than 1 year. Late latent syphilis occurs beyond 1 year.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0045">
<a id="o0985"></a>7. Primary syphilis is the acute infection. Secondary syphilis is manifested by mucocutaneous and constitutional signs and symptoms that are often associated with a maculopapular rash. Tertiary syphilis is a systemic disease involving the cardiovascular, skeletal, and central nervous system.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0050">
<a id="o0990"></a>8. Treponemal tests for syphilis are generally positive for life and do not indicate treatment response. RPR, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and the toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) are nontreponemal tests and correlate with disease activity. They usually become negative after treatment. Nontreponemal tests (RPR or VDRL) are used to monitor disease activity.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0055">
<a id="o0995"></a>9. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs when patients with syphilis are treated with penicillin, resulting in the release of toxic products when the treponemes are killed. The symptoms include headache, myalgia, fever, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0060">
<a id="o1000"></a>10. LGV presents as a single painless ulcer and painful inguinal adenopathy. LGV is marked by tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy, typically unilateral.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0065">
<a id="o1005"></a>11. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are used for diagnosing chlamydial infection.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0070">
<a id="o1010"></a>12. A strawberry rash on the vulva or strawberry cervix is seen in trichomoniasis.<a id="pg210"></a>
</li>
<li>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="210" id="pagebreak_210"></span>
</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0075">
<a id="o1015"></a>13. More than 99% of cervical cancers and 84% of anal cancers are associated with HPV 16 or 18. The most common serotype associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is HPV 16.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0080">
<a id="o1020"></a>14. Biopsies of genital warts are not routinely indicated but should be performed when the wart is atypical, pigmented, indurated, or fixed and ulcerated.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0085">
<a id="o1025"></a>15. HPV vaccine is recommended for females age 9 to 26 years and may also be given to males of the same age range.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0090">
<a id="o1030"></a>16. The presence of STIs increases the risk for concurrent HIV.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0095">
<a id="o1035"></a>17. Ulcerative STIs including herpes, syphilis, and chancroid enhance the susceptibility to HIV per sexual contact.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0100">
<a id="o1040"></a>18. Antiviral therapy for HIV does not necessarily make the patient noninfectious.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0105">
<a id="o1045"></a>19. Men who are circumcised are at lower risk for HIV infection.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0110">
<a id="o1050"></a>20. There are two types of HIV viruses: HIV-1 and HIV-2. There are very few cases of HIV-2 in the developed world, and it is less easily transmitted and less virulent than HIV-1.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0115">
<a id="o1055"></a>21. HIV is a retrovirus that infects T cells and dendritic cells.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0120">
<a id="o1060"></a>22. Antiretroviral combination therapy delays the rate of progression of the disease and prolongs survival.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0125">
<a id="o1065"></a>23. Overt AIDS is marked by a low CD4+ T-cell count.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0130">
<a id="o1070"></a>24. Plasma HIV RNA load is the most accurate predictor of disease progression.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0135">
<a id="o1075"></a>25. The diagnosis of HIV is made by screening for anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 antibodies. If this is positive, confirmation is made by using Western blot analysis. After treatment, the nadir of plasma HIV RNA predicts long-term outcome.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0140">
<a id="o1080"></a>26. HIV testing is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a STI or at risk for STIs.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0145">
<a id="o1085"></a>27. HSV increases HIV replication in persons infected with both viruses.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0150">
<a id="o1090"></a>28. HPV infection increases the risk for carcinoma, especially in HIV-infected hosts.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0155">
<a id="o1095"></a>29. The most common intrascrotal pathologic process in AIDS patients is testicular atrophy.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0160">
<a id="o1100"></a>30. Voiding dysfunction is common in patients with advanced HIV infection.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0165">
<a id="o1105"></a>31. Urinary calculi have been associated with, most notably, protease inhibitors such as indinavir. These stones are soluble at an acidic pH.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0170">
<a id="o1110"></a>32. HIV-associated nephropathy is a glomerular disease that often presents as proteinuria.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0175">
<a id="o1115"></a>33. Patients with HIV are at particular increased risk for Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Kaposi sarcoma presents as a raised, firm, indurated purplish plaque, reflecting the presence of abundant blood vessels, extravasated erythrocytes, and siderophages.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0180">
<a id="o1120"></a>34. Human herpesvirus 8 is essential for all forms of Kaposi sarcoma.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0185">
<a id="o1125"></a>35. HIV protease inhibitors are also potent antiangiogenic molecules and are useful in treating Kaposi sarcoma. However, localized lesions may be treated by irradiation, laser, cryotherapy, or intralesional injections of antineoplastic drugs. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat the lesions.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0190">
<a id="o1130"></a>36. There is an increased incidence of Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer in patients with HIV infection. There also appears to be an increased incidence of the following GU tumors: testicular, renal, and penile.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0195">
<a id="o1135"></a>37. The risk of untreated chlamydial infection producing pelvic inflammatory disease is estimated to be between 9.5% and 27% of cases.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0200">
<a id="o1140"></a>38. Current treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum are ceftriaxone 250 mg IM single-dose PLUS azithromycin, 1 g orally in single dose or doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice per day for 7 days.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0205">
<a id="o1145"></a>39. Donovan bodies noted in granuloma inguinale are intracellular inclusions of the bacteria within the cytoplasm of macrophages and appear deep purple when stained with a Wright, Giemsa, or Leishman stain.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0210">
<a id="o1150"></a>40. Characteristic findings for bacterial vaginosis on microscopic exam are clue cells, which are vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0215">
<a id="o1155"></a>41. Factors that increase the risk for transmitting HIV include deep as opposed to superficial exposure (OR 15, 95% CI 6 to 41), visible blood on the injuring device (OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 21), prior placement of the injuring device in an artery or vein (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 12), and patient dying within 2 months of the exposure (preterminal disease) (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2 to 16).</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0220">
<a id="o1160"></a>42. PDE5 inhibitors depend on CYP3A for clearance, and all protease inhibitors and NNRTIs are inhibitors of CYP3A to some extent. This can lead to a significant increase in the serum dose of PDE5 inhibitors, and therefore they should be started at the lowest possible dose in patients on these antiretroviral medications.</li>
