<ul class="ce_list" id="olist0110">
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0015">
<a id="o0570"></a>1. PSA levels are lower in hypogonadal men; statins may reduce PSA, whereas BPH, prostatitis, prostate manipulation, and prostate cancer increase serum levels of PSA.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0020">
<a id="o0575"></a>2. PSA may be elevated within 24 hours following ejaculation; DRE does not result in a significant fluctuation of PSA.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0025">
<a id="o0580"></a>3. Surgical therapy for BPH may reduce PSA.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0030">
<a id="o0585"></a>4. A PSA velocity of more than 0.75 ng/mL/year in patients with levels between 4 and 10 prompts a concern for prostate cancer; a PSA density (PSAD) may also be used in this group for risk assessment.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0035">
<a id="o0590"></a>5. A low noncomplexed PSA (free PSA) has a higher association with prostate cancer than does a high level of free PSA (&gt;25%) in patients with PSAs between 4 and 10 ng/mL.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0040">
<a id="o0595"></a>6. Prostate cancer screening was found in one study to reduce the rate of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and reduce prostate-specific mortality; however, in another prospective study there was no reduction in prostate-specific mortality with screening. Moreover, it may increase morbidity due to increased unnecessary biopsies or treatment in some men.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0045">
<a id="o0600"></a>7. There is some evidence that a PSA less than 1 ng/mL in patients aged 40 to 45 years may be used to inform the frequency of screening.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0050">
<a id="o0605"></a>8. African Americans have higher PSA values than whites.</li>
<li class="b1numlist" id="bpar0055">
<a id="o0610"></a>9. A tertiary pattern of Gleason grade is reported if there is a small focus of a higher grade than the primary and secondary grades. The Gleason sum is a combination of the primary grade and the highest grade.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0060">
<a id="o0615"></a>10. Bone scans are not appropriate for staging unless the PSA is greater than 20 ng/mL, the clinical stage is T3 or T4, or the patient has specific complaints referable to the bones.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0065">
<a id="o0620"></a>11. MRI with diffusion-weighting and dynamic contrast enhancement has improved the specificity of MRI to predict cancer.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0070">
<a id="o0625"></a>12. Specific criteria for who should have a pelvic lymphadenectomy as a preliminary staging procedure or combined with a radical prostatectomy have not been firmly established. At the very least, it probably should be done in patients with a Gleason score greater than 8, enlarged nodes on imaging, T3 disease on rectal exam, and/or a PSA greater than 20 ng/mL.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0075">
<a id="o0630"></a>13. The majority of men (80%) who have prostate cancer with PSA values less than 4 ng/mL have pathologically organ-confined disease, two-thirds of men with PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/mL have organ-confined cancer, and more than 50% of men with PSA levels more than 10 ng/mL have disease beyond the prostate. Pelvic lymph node involvement is found in nearly 20% of men with PSA levels greater than 20 ng/mL and in most men (75%) with serum PSA levels greater than 50 ng/mL.</li>
<li class="b1numlista" id="bpar0080">
<a id="o0635"></a>14. The “Partin tables” are probability tables for the determination of pathologic stage that are based on three parameters: preoperative clinical stage, serum PSA level, and Gleason sum.</li>
