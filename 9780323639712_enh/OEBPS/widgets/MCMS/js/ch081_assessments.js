        answer: [4],
        ansText: `Rationale: Knowledge on the lymphatic anatomy and spread of the penile tumors is crucial to understand the rationale for its surgical management. In this question, some critical points are highlighted. First is the fact that penile cancer usually spreads in a stepwise manner going from the inguinal nodes (superficial package first, then deep package) and pelvic nodes before the appearance of the distant metastatic lesions. However, due to the crossover of the lymphatic channels in the symphyseal region, the ILND should be performed bilaterally independently of the side affected. Furthermore, positive lymph nodes have proved to be a prognostic survival factor in several studies, which underlines the importance of undertaking this procedure when indicated. One of the indications for ILND are high-risk tumors; these are defined as T1 with high-grade and/or lymphovascular invasion and/or &gt;50% poorly undifferentiated. All T2 and T3 tumors are considered high risk.`,
