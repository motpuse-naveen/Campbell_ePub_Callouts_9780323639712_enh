Increase in fluid intake and use of PEG is unlikely to worsen lower urinary tract symptoms and is part of initial recommendations for bowel retraining.

Both open and laparoscopic procedures are associated with similar success rates. Both C-tubes and MACE-type channels provide independence and allow patients greater ability to perform irrigations without assistance in comparison to self-administered retrograde enemas. The underlying diagnosis influences the success rate. Patients with a neuropathic bowel and anorectal malformations seem to fare better than those with chronic idiopathic constipation.

Proponents in favor of routine use argue that the study can clearly demonstrate the amount of fecal loading and delineate stool distribution throughout the colon and rectum, as well as help ascertain for the presence of fecal impaction. In addition, it may also reveal associated pathologies, such as bony abnormalities indicative of occult spinal dysraphism or sacral agenesis, and help provide a visual aid for family and patient recognition of stool retention despite a history of regular defecation.</b> Colonic transit time studies are not recommended for routine diagnosis of functional constipation, being reserved for difficult-to-treat or unresponsive cases. Similarly, contrast enema series can be of value in selected cases, such as the evaluation of children with characteristics suggestive of Hirschsprung disease and repaired congenital anatomic abnormalities (i.e., anorectal malformation). Concern for a neuropathic process and/or lower spine stigmata should be evaluated with a spine ultrasound (if detected before calcification of the vertebral bodies in the first 3 to 6 months of life) or a lumbosacral MRI in older children. Anorectal manometry is useful only in very selected cases, such as suspected Hirschsprung disease and internal sphincter achalasia. In these conditions, the rectoanal relaxation reflex is absent.

        optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
        answer: [3],
        ansText: `Rationale: In children who require synchronous bladder reconstruction, a simultaneous MACE and Mitrofanoff urinary diversion offers the opportunity for dual fecal and urinary continence. If both a MACE and appendicovesicostomy are considered—and if the appendix is long enough with suitable, robust vascular anatomy—it is possible to split it. Previous surgical interventions are not an absolute contraindication for a laparoscopic approach, although the situation does demand for great care when entering the peritoneal cavity to avoid injuries related to adhesions or fibrosis. Although preoperative bowel preparation may facilitate the initiation of postoperative enemas, an aggressive cleanout is not necessary for the purpose of performing the procedure. Many patients with neuropathic bladder and bowel dysfunction have ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Although it is critical that appropriate use of prophylactic antibiotics and measures to minimize spillage be set in place, the presence of a shunt is not a contraindication for open or laparoscopic reconstruction involving bowel segments. Many descriptions of the MACE procedure propose an “anti-reflux” valve mechanism to prevent leakage of bowel contents via the cutaneous stoma. This is often achieved by wrapping the appendix with the cecal wall. However, recent reports have suggested that it is not always necessary to construct an anti-reflux mechanism. Thus far, data appear to support no increase in stomal bowel incontinence, based on retrospective reviews comparing MACE with and without cecal wrap. `,

        optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
        answer: [0],
        ansText: `Rationale: Cecostomy tubes are favored when the appendix is known to be absent (i.e., postappendectomy), when the patient refuses to perform intermittent bowel catheterization, for patients who develop stomal complications such as stenosis (as an alternative to revision of the MACE channel), as a temporary therapeutic challenge to determine response to antegrade enemas, to determine if ideal placement of a permanent MACE should be in the right or left colon, and as a permanent option in cases in which a nonoperative access is favored. The main drawback is that the tube entry site can become unsightly, with granulation tissue and occasional fecal leakage. Stenosis is very rare, in contrast to issues related to MACE channels. In addition, regular instrumentation is needed in order to change the tube on a scheduled basis (i.e., every 6 to 12 months), or sooner if it dislodges or breaks. Patients may opt for subsequent formal conversion to a bowel-based MACE, which can be done either laparoscopically or open. Compliance with antegrade enema regimens is crucial for success, irrespective of how the bowel access has been achieved (C-tube or MACE). `,

Enema protocols differ among centers, and patients and families will frequently modify them to suit their own particular needs. Initially, daily washouts with 20 mL/kg of solution are encouraged, but once the patient is comfortable with the process and a routine has been established, they may attempt to decrease frequency to alternate days. The time of day that the enema is administered is patient dependent, although most families prefer to give the enema during the early evening hours, after dinner.

        ansText: `Rationale: Constipation is common and should be suspected in any patient who presents with lower urinary tract symptoms. Programs dealing with incontinence and dysfunctional voiding have successfully included this aspect of care into their protocols. Dysfunctional voiding and constipation should be addressed before proceeding with surgical correction and can be done by a pediatric urologist or urology nurse practitioner, assisted by the child’s primary care physician. `,

        ansText: `Rationale: The physical examination and imaging studies are suggestive of severe constipation and stool impaction. Decreasing fecal load in the colon and rectum is the first step toward establishing an optimal medical regimen. <b>Impaction should be suspected when a mass is felt in the lower abdomen and/or left lower quadrant, or a dilated rectum filled with a large amount of stool is seen on pelvic ultrasound or abdominal radiography (as shown in </b><a class="lightboxcallout" img-ref="image_fig_36_1" href="12c664cf38ae46b9a84b460262e5d82c"><b>Fig. 36.1</b></a>). Approximately 30% of children with functional constipation present with fecal impaction. Disimpaction and bowel washout address the problem in a relatively short period of time, often with enemas or suppositories, in contrast to maintenance therapy. Popular regimens also include “high-dose” PEG with or without sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, or mineral oil enemas. In some circumstances clearance can only be achieved with digital disimpaction under sedation or anesthesia. The addition of fiber to the diet is bound to worsen the problem by increasing fecal load and is generally avoided during the initial management of fecal impaction.`,
