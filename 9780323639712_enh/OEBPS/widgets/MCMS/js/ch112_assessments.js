However, local hormone replacement therapy can be helpful in the treatment of urgency incontinence.

    answer: [0],
    ansText: `Rationale: The Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification (“POP-Q”) system is a 9-measure system that was created in an effort to provide objectivity to POP quantification. Six vaginal points labeled Aa, Ba, C, D, Ap, and Bp are measured in relation to the hymenal ring during a Valsalva maneuver. Aa and Ba represent points along the anterior vaginal wall, while Ap and Bp represent the posterior wall. Point C is the most distal point of the vaginal cuff or cervix, and D is the distance to the posterior fornix and is measured only if the cervix is still present. Points above the hymen are considered negative and points below the hymen are positive with a maximal established range of −3 to +3. The remaining three points are the genital hiatus (gh), which represents the size of the vaginal opening; the perineal body (pb), which represents the distance between the vagina and the anus; and the total vaginal length (tvl), which is measured by reducing the prolapse and measuring the depth of the vagina. A staging system based upon the above measurements ranges from stage 0 (no prolapse), in which all A and B points are −3, to stage 4, in which the leading edge is an absolute number that is no less than tvl −&lt;2 cm (and is preceded by a “+” since it is below the hymen).`,

    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [4],
    ansText: `Rationale: Oral pyridium will be excreted in the urine, so it will discolor a vaginal tampon whether the fistula is vesicovaginal or ureterovaginal or both. Intravenous indigo carmine would also demonstrate tampon staining in a similar pattern, but this is not practical as it involves the need for intravenous access. Presumably, staining higher on the tampon would indicate a ureterovaginal fistula, while lower staining would suggest a vesicovaginal fistula, but it can be difficult to differentiate with certainty as the dye can diffuse and 12% of patients with a vesicovaginal fistula have a concomitant ureteral fistula. Direct placement of dye (i.e., indigo carmine or methylene blue) into the bladder would only discolor the tampon if there is involvement of the bladder, but an isolated ureterovaginal fistula would be missed with this method. The best dye administration to evaluate for an isolated ureterovaginal fistula would be simultaneous intravesical blue dye and oral pyridium that would reveal orange staining only.`,

The study can determine bladder sensation, compliance, stability, and capacity as well as outlet competence and PVR. A 60-mL catheter tip syringe with the barrel removed is placed into the end of the catheter through which the bladder is filled by gravity. The height of the meniscus above the bladder represents the intravesical pressure. During the filling phase, a rise and fall in the meniscus may represent bladder overactivity, whereas a consistent gradual rise suggests compromised detrusor compliance. Because of the absence of the abdominal pressure (Pabd) channel, no information about the contribution of abdominal pressure is gleaned, and it is therefore not possible to definitively establish the presence or absence of significant outlet obstruction. Similarly, there is no information about urethral function or EMG afforded by this method, thereby making c, d, and e incorrect responses.`,
