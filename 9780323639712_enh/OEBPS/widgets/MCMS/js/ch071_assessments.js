    answer: [4],
    ansText: `Rationale: Based on functional, central, and peripheral mediation, the ejaculatory process is typically subdivided into three phases: emission, ejection (or penile expulsion), and orgasm. Emission consists of contractions of seminal vesicles (SV) and the prostate, with expulsion of sperm and seminal fluid into the posterior urethra, and is mediated by synergistic activation of both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves (T10 to L2) but may also include a cholinergic excitatory mechanism. Ejection is mediated by somatic nerves (S2 to S4) within the pudendal nerve, and involves pulsatile contractions of the bulbocavernosus and pelvic floor muscles together with contraction of the internal urinary sphincter to prevent retrograde ejaculation. Ejection also involves a sympathetic spinal cord reflex upon which there is limited voluntary control. The bladder neck closes to prevent retrograde flow; the bulbocavernosus, bulbospongiosus, and other pelvic floor muscles contract rhythmically, and the internal urinary sphincter contracts. The external urinary sphincter exhibits intense contractions interrupted by silence periods during ejection of semen. `,

    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [1],
    ansText: `Rationale: The medical literature contains several univariate and multivariate operational definitions of PE. Each of these definitions characterize men with PE using all or most of the accepted dimensions of this condition: ejaculatory latency, perceived ability to control ejaculation, reduced sexual satisfaction, personal distress, partner distress, and interpersonal or relationship distress. The first official definition of PE was established in 1980 by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in the DSM-III. The current APA DSM-V definition of PE is largely based upon the unified PE definition of the ISSM and captures the key dimensions of latency, control, and bother. Earlier DSM definitions did not include latency.<br/><br/>Several observational studies in cohorts of heterosexual men with lifelong PE with prospective stopwatch IELT measurement showed that about 90% of men seeking treatment for lifelong PE ejaculated within 1 minute after penetration, and about 10% ejaculated between 1 and 2 minutes. These data support the proposal that lifelong PE is characterized by an IELT of less than or about 1 minute after vaginal penetration.<br/><br/>Recent studies have suggested that in some men neurobiological and genetic variations could contribute to the pathophysiology of lifelong premature ejaculation (L-PE), as defined by the ISSM criteria and that the condition may be maintained and heightened by psychological/environmental factors. Acquired PE is commonly due to sexual performance anxiety, psychological or relationship problems, ED, and occasionally prostatitis, hyperthyroidism, or during withdrawal/detoxification from prescribed or recreational drugs.<br/><br/>Four PE subtypes are distinguished on the basis of the duration of the IELT, frequency of complaints, and course in life. In addition to lifelong PE and acquired PE, this classification includes natural variable PE (or variable PE) and premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction (or subjective PE). Men with subjective PE complain of PE, while actually having a normal or even extended ejaculation time. The complaint of PE in these men is probably related to psychological and/or cultural factors.  `,

    ansText: `Rationale: In October 2007, the ISSM convened an initial meeting of the first Ad Hoc ISSM Committee for the Definition of Premature Ejaculation to develop the first contemporary, evidence-based definition of lifelong PE. Evidence-based definitions seek to limit errors of classification and thereby increase the likelihood that existing and newly developed therapeutic strategies are truly effective in carefully selected dysfunctional populations.<br/><br/>The committee unanimously agreed that the constructs that are necessary to define lifelong PE are time from penetration to ejaculation, inability to delay ejaculation, and negative personal consequences from PE, and they recommended the following definition. “<b><i>Lifelong PE is a male sexual dysfunction characterized by the presence of all of these criteria: (1) ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about 1 minute of vaginal penetration; (2) the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations; and (3) negative personal consequences such as distress, bother, frustration, and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy.”</i></b><br/><br/>In April 2013, a second Ad Hoc ISSM Committee for the Definition of Premature Ejaculation agreed that although lifelong and acquired PE are distinct and different demographic and etiological populations, they can be jointly defined, in part, by the constructs of time from penetration to ejaculation, inability to delay ejaculation, and negative personal consequences from PE. The committee determined that the presence of a clinically significant and bothersome reduction in latency time, often to about 3 minutes or less, was an additional key defining dimension of acquired PE. This definition is limited to men engaging in vaginal intercourse as there are few studies available on PE research in homosexual men or during other forms of sexual expression. `,

    ansText: `Rationale: Waldinger et al. (1998) reported IELTs less than 30 seconds in 77% and less than 60 seconds in 90% of 110 men with lifelong PE with only 10% ejaculating between 1 and 2 minutes. These data are consistent with normative community IELT data, support the notion that IELTs of less than 1 minute are statistically abnormal, and confirm that an IELT cut-off of 1 minute will capture 80% to 90% of treatment-seeking men with lifelong PE. A post hoc analysis of the dapoxetine Phase 3 COUPLE trial data confirms a statistically significant higher IELT in men with acquired PE and comorbid compared to men with lifelong PE with comorbid ED. Additional recent studies support this report and confirm that self-estimated IELT was lower in men with lifelong PE compared to acquired PE and highest in men with subjective PE. These data suggest 3 minutes as a valid cut-off for either self-estimated or stopwatch IELT for the diagnosis of acquired PE.<br/><br/>Several authors report that estimated and stopwatch IELT correlate reasonably well or are interchangeable in assigning PE status when estimated IELT is combined with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Since patient self-report is the determining factor in treatment seeking and satisfaction, it is recommended that self-estimation by the patient and partner of ejaculatory latency is accepted as the method for determining IELT in clinical practice.<br/><br/>The ability to prolong sexual intercourse by delaying ejaculation and the subjective feelings of ejaculatory control comprise the complex construct of ejaculatory control. Virtually all men report using at least one cognitive or behavioral technique to prolong intercourse and delay ejaculation, with varying degrees of success, and many young men reported using multiple different techniques. Voluntary delay of ejaculation is most likely exerted either prior to or in the early stages of the emission phase of the reflex but progressively decreases until the point of ejaculatory inevitability.<br/><br/>Several authors have reported an association between lifelong or acquired PE and negative psychological outcomes in men with lifelong or acquired PE and their female partners. This personal distress has discriminative validity in diagnosing men with and without PE. The personal and/or interpersonal distress, bother, frustration, and annoyance that result from PE may affect men’s quality of life and partner relationships, their self-esteem and self-confidence, and can act as an obstacle to single men forming new partner relationships.`,

As a result, there is a substantial disparity between the incidence of PE in epidemiological studies that rely upon either patient self-report of PE and/or inconsistent and poorly validated definitions of PE.<br/><br/>Community-based stopwatch studies of the IELT, the time interval between penetration and ejaculation, demonstrate that the distribution of the IELT is positively skewed, with a median IELT of 5.4 minutes (range, 0.55 to 44.1 minutes), decreases with age and varies between countries, and supports the notion that IELTs of less than 1 minute are statistically abnormal compared to men in the general western population.<br/><br/>Early ejaculation in humans has been explained by either hyposensitivity of the 5-HT2C and/or hypersensitivity of the 5-HT1A receptor.

It is occasionally characterized by the use of idiosyncratic and vigorous masturbation styles that cannot be replicated during intercourse with a partner, or an “autosexual” orientation where men derive greater arousal and enjoyment from masturbation than from intercourse.

    ansText: `Rationale: <b>a. Retrograde ejaculation can be confirmed by the presence of spermatozoa in post-masturbation first-void urine</b> and <b>c. Retrograde ejaculation may occur in men with diabetic autonomic neuropathy.</b> Antegrade (normal) ejaculation requires a closed bladder neck (and proximal urethra). Surgical procedures that compromise the bladder neck closure mechanism may result in retrograde ejaculation. The occurrence of orgasm in the absence of prograde ejaculation suggests retrograde ejaculation and can be confirmed by the presence of spermatozoa in post-masturbation first void urine.<br/><br/>Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) results in retrograde ejaculation in 5% to 45% of patients and is probably related to whether one or two incisions are made and whether or not the incision includes primarily the bladder neck or extends to the level of the verumontanum. The importance of contraction of the urethral smooth muscle at the level of the verumontanum has been hypothesized to be important in preventing retrograde ejaculation. TURP carries a higher incidence of retrograde ejaculation than does TUIP. The reported incidence of retrograde ejaculation following TURP ranges from 42% to 100%.<br/><br/>Retrograde ejaculation is more common in diabetes mellitus (DM) than in age-matched controls (<b><i>P</i></b> &lt; .01), has been reported in 30% of men with DM, and is not statistically associated with duration of DM, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or HgbA1c or total testosterone levels.<br/><br/>Several sympathomimetic amine agents have been described as useful with mixed results. These drugs include pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, midodrine, and phenylpropanolamine. These agents work by stimulating the release of noradrenaline from the nerve axon terminals but may also directly stimulate both α- and β-adrenergic receptors. The TCA imipramine, which blocks the reuptake of noradrenaline by the axon from the synaptic cleft, is also occasionally useful. The usual dose is 25 mg twice daily. The current feeling is that long-term treatment with imipramine is likely to be more effective. While medical treatment may not always produce normal ejaculation, it may result in some prograde ejaculation. `,
