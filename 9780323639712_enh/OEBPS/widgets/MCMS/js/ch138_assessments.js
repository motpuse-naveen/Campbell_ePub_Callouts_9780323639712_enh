    ansText: `Rationale: In a seminal randomized trial, Grossman and colleagues compared the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer with radical cystectomy alone or surgery followed by three cycles of MVAC chemotherapy (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin). They demonstrated a significant improvement in survival (46 vs. 77 months) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm. This study serves as the basis for current treatment paradigms in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Grossman et al., 2003).<sup>a</sup>

    answer: [2],
    ansText: `Rationale: Conventional staging evaluation for upper-tract urothelial carcinoma should include evaluation of both the kidney parenchyma and the urothelial lumen. Although PET/CT can be useful for a staging evaluation, the resolution of imaging within the urinary tract is limited by the excretion of contrast material and lack of granular resolution.`,
