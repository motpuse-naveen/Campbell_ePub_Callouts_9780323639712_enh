Both reflexes promote urine storage under sympathetic tone.</b> The guarding reflex guards or prevents urine loss in times of cough or other physical stress that would normally trigger a micturition episode. Suprapontine input from the brain turns off the guarding reflex during micturition to allow efficient and complete emptying. The bladder afferent reflex works through sacral interneurons that then activate storage through pudendal nerve efferent pathways directed toward the urethral sphincter. Similar to the guarding reflex, the bladder afferent reflex promotes continence during periods of bladder filling and is quiet during micturition.`,

The chief application is in patients with inefficient or no reflex micturition after spinal cord injury. Simultaneous bladder and striated sphincter stimulation is obviated by sacral posterior rhizotomy, usually complete, which also (1) eliminates reflex incontinence and (2) improves low bladder compliance, if present. Electrodes are applied intradurally or extradurally to the S2, S3, and S4 roots, but the pairs can be activated independently. The current Brindley stimulator uses the principle of <b><i>poststimulus voiding,</i></b> a term first introduced by Jonas and Tanagho (1975). Relaxation time of the striated sphincter after a stimulus train is shorter than the relaxation time of the detrusor smooth muscle. Therefore, when interrupted pulse trains instead of continuous stimulus trains are used, poststimulus voiding is achieved between the pulse trains because of the higher sustained intravesical pressure when compared with the striated sphincter.`,

    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>e. All of the above.</b>--> <b>Although there are some urodynamic data for prediction of PTNS results (Vandoninck et al.), the overall availability of urodynamic data is scarce and contradictory. So we don’t know the real value of this diagnostic tool for prediction of PTNS. There is no direct comparison yet of PTNS with a tibial nerve stimulation implanted device, although the expectation is that the implant is more efficacious. In line with this, there is no direct comparison of tibial nerve devices and sacral nerve devices. One of the assets of tibial nerve implants is that they are small because they lack a battery. Thus battery life is not an issue for the PTNS devices.</b>`,
