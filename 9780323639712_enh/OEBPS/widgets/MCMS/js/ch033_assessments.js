    ansText: `Rationale: Fetal and neonatal lower urinary tract obstruction due to posterior urethral valves may transmit enough pressure to the upper urinary tract to cause a rupture of a calyceal fornix causing urine to be trapped within the renal capsule or cause ascites, in rare cases. However, bladder perforation is not a characteristic of posterior urethral valves, since the process actually leads to significant bladder wall hypertrophy. `,

    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [2],
    ansText: `Rationale: Thickened dilated bladder and bilateral upper tract dilation imply posterior urethral valves with high sensitivity. Criteria for intervention include favorable urinary chemistry, a singleton pregnancy, normal karyotype, and absence of significant dysplasia. Antenatal intervention includes vesicoamniotic shunting and fetal cystoscopic ablation. Vesicoamniotic shunting is associated with an increased incidence of live births in the severely affected fetus, but is not correlated with decreasing the risk of renal failure. Early reports suggest fetal cystoscopy and ablation are more accurate in diagnosing valve patients and thus have better outcomes. Experience in antenatal intervention is early and varied and hence should only be offered in highly selected cases. `,

    answer: [3],
    ansText: `Rationale: The theory of the valve bladder syndrome holds that while the bladder initially compensates for outlet obstruction by generating high voiding pressures, it begins to experience higher volumes of urine due to increasing urine production as the child grows. The polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus secondary to evolving renal impairment augments the urine volumes entering a bladder that is increasingly unable to empty completely. As the post-void residuals increase, the bladder no longer enjoys periods of complete relaxation, and the detrusor fibers are continuously in a state of partial or complete stretch, beginning a cascade of gene expression and phenotypic changes that further impair contractility of the bladder.
