They are described as those which form without any predisposing cause.</b>--> Primary bladder stones usually are described as those which form without any predisposing cause, while a secondary cause is found in most patients with certain predisposing causes. The primary bladder stones are historically known to occur associated with nutritional deficiency. These are known to be rampant in undernourished or nutritionally compromised individuals. The cause for formation of these calculi are believed to be a combination of decreased urine output, alteration in the urine pH, and other metabolic abnormalities. Vitamin deficiency and dietary compromise in the form of deficient animal proteins is responsible in the genesis of these stones. The primary bladder stones are known to form within the first 5 years of life and have a male preponderance to them. `,

        ansText:`Rationale: <!--<b>a. The majority of urethral stones are radiolucent and not visible on plain radiographs.</b>--> The majority of urethral stones are radio-opaque and visible on plain radiographs. Retrograde urethrogram can identify the stones as filling defect and has been the mainstay of investigation. Transrectal ultrasonography can identify the prostatic urethral calculi as a hyperechoic structure with postacoustic shadowing. A high-frequency (10 MHz) linear transducer placed on the dorsal surface of the penis along its long axis can screen the entire urethra. Upper tract stones may coexist and hence advocate an ultrasonography of the kidney, ureter, and bladder or a cross-sectional computerized tomography, especially if there exists a strong suspicion.`,

Shockwave lithotripsy after pushback is successful, with a stone-free rate of roughly 60%. Intracorporeal laser lithotripsy is less traumatic to the mucosa, with a guaranteed success rate of 85% to 90%. For stones that do not get pushed back into the bladder, in situ fragmentation using laser or pneumatic lithotripsy should be undertaken.`,

Small stones can be milked out of the external meatus, but irregular and large stones should not be milked as they cause urethral damage. Holmium laser is least traumatic when used for anterior urethra. A ventral meatotomy helps in controlled removal of the stone and actually reduces urethral trauma.`,
