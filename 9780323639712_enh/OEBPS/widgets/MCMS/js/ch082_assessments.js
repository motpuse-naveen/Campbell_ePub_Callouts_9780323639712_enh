        ansText: `Rationale: The term <b><i>graft</i></b> implies that tissue has been excised and transferred to a graft host bed, where a new blood supply develops by a process termed <b><i>take.</i></b> Take requires approximately 96 hours and occurs in two phases. The initial phase, imbibition, requires about 48 hours. During that phase, the graft survives by “drinking” nutrients from the adjacent graft host bed, and the temperature of the graft is less than the core body temperature. The second phase, inosculation, also requires about 48 hours and is the phase in which true microcirculation is reestablished in the graft. During that phase, the temperature of the graft rises to core body temperature. The process of take is influenced by both the nature of the grafted tissue and the conditions of the graft host bed. Processes that interfere with the vascularity of the graft host bed thus interfere with graft take.`,

        ansText: `Rationale: The epidermal, or epithelial layer, is a covering, the barrier to the “outside,” and is adjacent to the superficial dermis, or superficial lamina. At approximately that interface is the superficial plexus. In the case of skin, the plexus is the intradermal plexus. There are some lymphatics in the superficial dermal or tunica layer. On the undersurface of the deep dermal layer or deep lamina is the deep plexus. In the case of skin, this is the subdermal plexus. <b>The deep dermis contains most of the lymphatics and greater collagen content than found in the superficial dermal layer.</b> The deep or reticular dermis is generally thought to account for the physical characteristics of the tissue. There is a difference between genital full-thickness skin (penile and preputial skin grafts) and extragenital full-thickness skin. This is probably a reflection of the increased mass of the graft in extragenital skin grafts. This increased mass makes the graft more fastidious, and the poor results reported with urethral reconstruction with extragenital FTSGs are probably due to poor or ischemic take. `,

This should not preclude replantation unless the patient adamantly refuses such treatment. Even then, with a court order and the agreement of two or more surgeons, replantation may be undertaken. If possible, microreplantation should be carried out. This technique consists of an anatomic approximation of the tunica albuginea of the corporal bodies, a spatulated two-layer anastomosis of the urethra. The dorsal nerves are coapted using an epineural technique unless the injury is distal, at which point a vesicular coaptation may be required. The dorsal vein is anastomosed, and the dorsal arteries are anastomosed. Anastomosis of the cavernosal arteries is not possible and should not be attempted. If the situation is such that microreplantation cannot be undertaken, then the technique described by McRoberts can be carried out. His series and other series show that a high degree of success can be expected after replantation without microvascular reanastomosis. In most patients, however, they will have numbness distal to the replant site. With microreplantation, it is not at all unusual for patients to have excellent sensation distal to the area of injury and to have resumption of normal erectile function.<br/><br/>If the patient presents with the distal part having been disposed of or otherwise unavailable, then the wound should be closed. Often the penis will have been stretched during the amputation and an excess of skin will have been removed, leaving a good length intact with denuded penile shaft structures. In that case, the corporeal bodies would be closed, the urethral meatus must be spatulated, and the penis can be immediately covered with an STSG. If the injury occurs because of avulsion, replantation is not an option as the stretch injury to the spermatic vessels or vessels of the penis causes unpredictable damage to the endothelium.`,

        ansText: `Rationale: Patients with lymphedema can readily undergo reconstruction. When the lymphedematous tissue has been excised, the testes will be free and, as in a degloving injury, they must be fixed in the midline in an anatomically correct position. The shaft of the penis should be covered with a STSG. If the scrotum cannot be closed, a meshed STSG is used to cover the testes, as described. Not uncommonly, these patients have hydroceles, the parietal tunica vaginalis must be excised, and grafting can be done directly onto the visceral tunica vaginalis of the testicles. <b>Unlike the full-thickness skin flap (FTSF), split-thickness skin carries little of the reticular dermis and hence few of the lymphatic channels.</b> Reaccumulation of lymphedema will occur within a FTSG and can recur in a thick STSG. In many cases of lymphedema limited to the genitalia, the posterior scrotal skin and the lateral scrotal skin are spared from the lymphedematous process. Thus, in some cases, primary closure after excision can be accomplished using these tissues. If grafting is required, using these tissues to blend the grafts into the groin and perineum technically is much easier. The lymphedematous process involves recurrent cellulitis, lymphedema, and the development of lymphangiectasia. Lymphangiectasia can look like genital papilloma; however, it is a very different process. If there is any question, biopsy can clarify the issue.`,

This location might be questioned, however, based on the location of the urethra within the corpus spongiosum. Distally, although the anterior aspect of the corpus spongiosum is thicker, a deep incision in the more distal aspects of the anterior urethra will certainly enter the corpora cavernosa, and these incisions have been associated with the creation of ED. The most common complication of internal urethrotomy is recurrence of stricture. Less commonly noted complications of internal urethrotomy include bleeding and extravasation of irrigation fluid into the perispongiosal tissues. <b>One report that used the actuarial technique showed the curative success rate of internal urethrotomy to be 29% to 30% for all patients.

With vigorous mobilization, development of the intracrural space, and detachment of the bulbospongiosum from the perineal body, significant lengths of stricture can be excised and reanastomosed. For very proximal bulbous strictures, tension-free anastomosis can be facilitated by the dissection of the membranous urethra. As a rule, the closer the stricture is to the membranous urethra, the longer it can be and still be reconstructed by anastomotic techniques. The tenet that excision and primary anastomosis should be the goal for all bulbous strictures is one that is being further reinforced by current published series. Although guideline lengths of 1 to 2 cm are valuable for planning, most would agree that if excision and primary anastomosis is possible it should be done, and, with aggressive dissection and the maneuvers described earlier, often strictures much longer than the “guideline lengths” can be so reconstructed.`,

Because of their congenital anomaly, these patients often become relatively reclusive and have poor self and genital images and may benefit from sex therapy. Even in patients with obvious abnormalities of the corpus spongiosum (i.e., poor ventral fusion or frank bifid corpus spongiosum), wide mobilization usually reveals that it is not the corpus spongiosum that remains as the ventral limiting factor. <b>In most patients, the penis will remain curved because of the inelasticity of the ventral aspect of the corpora cavernosa.</b> If the epithelial tube has served as an adequate urethra (i.e., it is not stenotic), the morbidity of the urethral division and subsequent need for urethral reconstruction must be considered before undertaking such a procedure. In children, after mobilization and excision of the dysgenetic tissues, the residual chordee can usually be corrected by making a longitudinal incision with a sharp blade.

Occasionally, however, a patient or his initial-care physician will ignore the stigmata of the trauma (often described as “minimal” by patients), and the patient will present with a noticeable lateral scar that causes both indentation of the lateral aspect of the penis and, in some cases, curvature. Patients who had preexisting lateral curvature may actually notice that their penis has been straightened by the trauma, but they are disturbed by the concavity caused by the scar. The pathology of a subclinical fracture of the penis is believed to be due to either the disruption of the outer longitudinal layer of the tunica albuginea during the buckling trauma only or the disruption of both layers of the tunica albuginea during the buckling trauma but with preservation of Buck fascia. These patients usually have normal erectile function, and there is no association with concomitant global CVOD. However, the association of CVOD and trauma of the penis continues to be seen, and some patients, after fracture-type injuries of the penis, will have significant problems with ED. These injuries are not associated with shortening of the penis. It is the lack of ED and penile shortening that help distinguish these patients from those with Peyronie disease. Although foreshortening of the penis is not a characteristic of either the injury itself or the resulting scar in either of these injuries, these patients are not thought to be best treated by approaching the opposite aspect of the scar and excising an ellipse of the tunica. This would result in bilateral scars, which will cause bilateral indentation of the penis, and although the penis will have been straightened by the correction, most patients are upset by the cosmetic and functional result of a near-circumferential indentation of the penis.

        ansText: `Rationale: Patients with an intact pudendal artery on one side are often potent and reliably cured with reconstruction. Patients with only reconstituted vessels, either unilateral or bilateral, are rarely potent but reliably reconstructed. Those patients at risk for ischemic stenosis are only those with bilateral complete obstruction of the internal pudendal vessels without reconstitution. In such a patient, we now perform penile arterial revascularization to augment the vascularity and, with that accomplished, then proceed to urethral reconstruction. Patients without ED by definition have normal penile hemodynamics and do not require further investigation before repair of a PFUI.`,

        ansText: `Rationale: Rigidity for intercourse in the patient with phallic construction is usually achieved by either an externally applied or a permanently implanted prosthesis. Prosthetic implantation is never undertaken until 1 year after phallic construction, because protective sensibility must be demonstrated in the flap. When the flap is transferred, it is, by definition, rendered insensate. At about 3 to 4 months after reconstruction, however, as nerve regeneration occurs, sensation becomes noticeable. In addition, before prosthetic implantation is undertaken, the urethra must be patent and proved to be durable.`,

In this situation, transecting techniques to repair urethral strictures should be avoided unless performed in a “vessel-sparing” fashion to avoid the risk of ischemic urethral stenosis. Inlay or onlay graft or flap techniques may be used in these patients, as these do not disrupt the proximal blood supply to the urethra.

It spares the bulbar urethral arteries but maintains the same principles of traditional excision and primary anastomosis (wide, spatulated, tension-free anastomosis). Originally intended to prevent potential future spongiosum atrophy in selected patients, it became part of the armamentarium in anterior urethral reconstruction for a variety of entities in some centers around the world, although it may be reserved for experienced urethral reconstructive surgeons. To date, there is no evidence of benefit in terms of overall outcome or prevention of de novo ED.
