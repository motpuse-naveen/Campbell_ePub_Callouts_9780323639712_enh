        ansText:`Rationale:<!--<b>b. Current is delivered to the tissue directly, causing it to heat.</b>--> Electrosurgery uses radiofrequency current in the range of 400,000 to 600,000 Hz to pass through tissue and create the desired effects. The generators deliver more than 100 W of power to the tissue at voltages ranging from 100 to 5000 V. While the current is delivered to the tissue, the tissue is heated and the effect occurs. This is in contrast to electrocautery, in which the instrument itself is heated and then applied to the tissue. `,

The 2140-nm wavelength is strongly absorbed in water, traveling only approximately 0.5 mm in the fluid medium, making it ideal for the urologic environment.

        ansText:`Rationale:<!--<b>d. Direct energy absorption.</b>--> Previous laser technologies (Ruby, Nd:YAG) used photoacoustic or photomechanical processes, where light energy created shock waves that fragmented stones. In contrast, the Ho:YAG laser uses photothermal lithotripsy, which involves direct light energy absorption (“photo”) by stone surfaces, causing rapid temperature (“thermal”) increases, before significant heat diffusion can occur. A “Moses effect” occurs by the rapid vaporization of fluid creating a vapor channel between the fiber tip and stone’s surface, allowing for more direct energy transfer. Interstitial water may also become vaporized, leading to fragment ejection; however, these forces are not great enough to directly lead to stone fracture. `,

        answer: [3],
        ansText:`Rationale:<!--<b>d. Stone retropulsion.</b>--> Pneumatic lithotripsy uses ballistic forces to transfer kinetic energy from a handheld probe to the stone surface. Repetitive strikes (12 Hz LithoClast, 15 to 30 Hz Electrokinetic lithotripter) from the probe tip act as a jackhammer, fragmenting stones at the point of contact. Stone migration is a significant disadvantage when treating ureteric stones because the probe’s ballistic effect can propel stones in capacious ureters into the kidney. Retropulsion has been reported in as much as 10% of distal and 40% of proximal stones treated with pneumatic lithotripsy. In a four-way comparison of intracorporeal lithotripters on iatrogenic urothelial trauma, pneumatic probes were found to be the least traumatic (compared with laser, ultrasonic, and EHL). Pneumatic lithotripters are currently one of the most cost effective because of their durability and use of reusable probes. `,

        ansText:`Rationale:<!--<b>c. Ultrasonic, laser, EHL.</b>--> Because of their mechanisms of action, EHL probes and laser fibers can fragment stones while being flexed; 200-μm laser fibers can be readily flexed 270 degrees in flexible ureteroscopes, whereas thin EHL probes (1.9 Fr) are flexible enough to reach the lower pole while conducting electrical pulses for spark discharge. Thin ultrasonic probes can be moderately deflected using flexible scopes; however, these wirelike probes lack a lumen for suction and suffer from significant dampening and reduced efficiency with flexion. Any amount of torque applied to pneumatic lithotrites significantly reduces the jackhammer-like movements and reduces fragmentation potential. Similarly, combination lithotrites cannot be flexed, nor are they available in sizes compatible with ureteroscopy. `,
