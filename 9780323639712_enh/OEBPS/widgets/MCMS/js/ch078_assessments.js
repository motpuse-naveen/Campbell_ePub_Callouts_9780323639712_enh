    q: `  A 23-year old man presents after undergoing transscrotal orchiectomy for presumed hydrocele. Pathologic examination reveals embryonal carcinoma with vascular invasion. Serum levels of tumor markers and results of physical examination and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were normal. Which of the following approaches is most appropriate?  `,

      `  Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND)  `,

      `  RPLND plus scrotal and inguinal radiation  `,
    ],
    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [2],
    ansText: `Rationale: In the setting of scrotal contamination and clinical stage I disease, the patient is best managed with RPLND and wide excision of the scrotal scar. The remainder of the cord should also be removed. Observation is not optimal because of the presence of vascular invasion and scrotal contamination.  `,

    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [4],
    ansText: `Rationale: Late relapse of germ cell tumor (GCT) after definitive therapy is defined as recurrence more than 2 years after completion of therapy and occurring without evidence of disease. Teratoma is the most common histologic subtype involved in cases of late relapse. This is likely due to its combination of prolonged doubling time and chemotherapy resistance.   `,

    q: ` A 25-year-old man with a stage IIC nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) has completed primary platinum-based chemotherapy. Tumor marker levels have normalized according to appropriate half-life, and he has undergone bilateral postchemotherapy RPLND. Final pathologic analysis reveals a focus of yolk sac tumor. Appropriate therapy at this point is   `,

    ],
    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [2],
    ansText: `Rationale: The patientâ€™s prognosis is related to serum tumor marker level at the time of RPLND, prior treatment burden, and the pathologic findings for the resected specimen. If viable GCT is present at any site but all disease is completely resected, two additional cycles provide survival benefit in this subset of patients. Einhorn reported only 2 long-term survivors of 22 patients (9%) with completely resected viable GCT after cisplatin, bleomycin, and vinblastine chemotherapy if additional postoperative chemotherapy was not given. Fox and colleagues reported that 70% of patients with completely resected viable GCT after primary chemotherapy followed by two cycles of postoperative chemotherapy remained disease free compared with none of 7 patients without additional chemotherapy.  `,

    q: `  A 20-year-old man with clinical stage I NSGCT undergoes laparoscopic RPLND. During surgery, a 2-cm lymph node is encountered. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  `,

    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
