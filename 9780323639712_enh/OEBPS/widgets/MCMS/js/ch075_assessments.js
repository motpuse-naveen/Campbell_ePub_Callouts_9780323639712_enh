The 11th and 12th ribs must be distinguished from the other ribs because they have no anterior connection with the sternum and are often referred to as floating ribs. The 10th rib is not a floating rib. These ribs are of clinical significance during palpation for the marking of a surgical incision. Bony landmarks are of critical importance for surgical incision planning, as they do not typically move. Landmarks like the umbilicus are less useful as they can change location depending on the positioning (e.g., an obese patient with a large pannus in flank position). The intercostal vessels and nerves travel between the internal intercostal and innermost intercostal muscles within the costal groove on the caudal margin of the superior rib.  `,
