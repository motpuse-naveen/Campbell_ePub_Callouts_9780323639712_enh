    ansText: `Rationale: Although PSA is widely accepted as a prostate cancer tumor marker, it is organ specific and not disease specific. Unfortunately, there is an overlap in the serum PSA levels among men with cancer and benign disease. Thus elevated serum PSA levels may reflect alterations within the prostate secondary to tissue architectural changes, such as cancer, inflammation, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).`,

    answer: [3],
    ansText: `Rationale: PSA originates with a 17–amino acid chain that is cleaved to yield a precursor inactive form of PSA termed proPSA (pPSA). The precursor form of PSA contains a 7–amino acid proleader peptide, in addition to the 237 constituent amino acids of mature PSA, and it is termed [&#8722;7]pPSA. Once released, the proleader amino acid chain is cleaved at the amino terminus by hK2, converting pPSA to its active 33-kD PSA form. In addition to hK2, pPSA may be activated to PSA by other prostate kallikreins, including hK4. Incomplete removal of the 7–amino acid leader chain has led to the identification of various other truncated or clipped forms of pPSA. These include pPSAs with 2-, 4-, and 5-leader amino acids ([&#8722;2]pPSA, [&#8722;4]pPSA, and [&#8722;5]pPSA). With cellular disruption, these inactive forms circulate as free PSA and may constitute the majority of the circulating free PSA in patients with prostate cancer.`,
