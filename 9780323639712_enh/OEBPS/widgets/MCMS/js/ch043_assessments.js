        ansText:`Rationale: D-penicillamine and alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine are thiol-containing medications that are used to treat cystinuria by increasing the urine solubility of cysteine. Potassium citrate is used to treat cystinuria by alkalizing the urine thereby increasing cysteine solubility if a pH of greater than 7.0 is maintained. High fluid intake is generally recommended to prevent urinary crystallization of all lithogenic substrates. Thiazide diuretics are generally used to treat hypercalciuria, which is not an expected feature in cystinuria.`,

Loop diuretics such as furosemide promote hypercalciuria and chronic usage is frequently associated with nephrocalcinosis. Indinavir is a protease inhibitor with poor urinary solubility and has the ability to crystallize and form calculi. Levetiracetam is an antiepileptic medication which is not associated with renal calculi.`,
