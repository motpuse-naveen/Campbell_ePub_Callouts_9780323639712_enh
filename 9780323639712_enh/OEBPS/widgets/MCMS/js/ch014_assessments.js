However, in patients with chronic respiratory disease, CO<sub>2</sub> may accumulate in the bloodstream to dangerous levels. In these patients, helium may be used for insufflation once the initial pneumoperitoneum has been established with CO<sub>2</sub>. The drawback of helium is that, like air, it is much less soluble in the blood than is CO<sub>2</sub>. However, its use averts problems with hypercarbia.

Conceivably, this assumes greater importance in patients with preexisting airway and cardiovascular compliance. Vigilant perioperative anesthetic management is essential to prevent the development of potential complications related to CO<sub>2</sub> buildup. A rise in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> should prompt the anesthesiologist to adjust the respiratory rate and tidal volume to enhance CO<sub>2</sub> elimination. Simultaneously, the insufflation pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> should be decreased by the surgeon or, if need be, the operation should be halted and the abdomen desufflated until the end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> returns to an acceptable level.`,

        ansText:`Rationale: <!--<b>e. All of the above.</b>--> Several actions can be taken by the surgeon to lessen the risks of a thermal complication. First, electrosurgical instruments must be carefully inspected before use for any “breaks” in the insulation; if these are found, the instrument must be sent for recoating. Second, electrosurgical instruments should never be left untended within the abdomen; when not in use, they must be removed from the abdomen. Third, only the primary surgeon should control electrode activation. Fourth, isolation of the area to be cauterized from the surrounding tissues, as well as use of bipolar electrocautery, reduces the risk of thermal spread and injury to other tissues. Fifth, the electrosurgical device should never be activated unless the entire extent of the metal portion of the instrument is in view. Sixth, problems of capacitive coupling can be precluded by not creating a situation in which a mixture of conducting and nonconducting elements are used by the surgeon (e.g., metal trocars combined with plastic retainers). Last, an active electrode monitoring system (Encision, Boulder, CO) is extremely helpful, as any sudden break in the insulation of the electrosurgical instrument results in immediate shutdown of the electrosurgical current, thereby precluding an electrosurgical injury.`,
