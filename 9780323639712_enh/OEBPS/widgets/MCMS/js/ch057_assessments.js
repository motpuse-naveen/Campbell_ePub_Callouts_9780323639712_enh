Urinary urgency is a term that is frequently misinterpreted by patients (painful urgency or urgency related to fear of urine loss) and not necessary for diagnosis.

This agent is an oral analog of heparin. The proposed mechanism of action is the correction of a GAG dysfunction, thus presumably reversing the abnormal epithelial permeability. Chronic use has recently been associated with pigmentary maculopathy and visual disturbances in some patients.`,

The presence of extravesical fat stranding is commonly seen on CT scan, is consistent with the panmural inflammatory process, and should have no bearing upon the indications for surgery.

Those with a history of sexual abuse may present with more pain and fewer voiding symptoms. How reliable these data are is not clear, and it would be wrong to jump to any conclusions about abuse in an individual patient. However, practitioners need to have sensitivity for the possibility of an abusive relationship history in all pain patients, and IC/BPS patients in particular. When patients are found to have multiple diagnoses, the rate of previous abuse also increases, and these patients may need referral for further counseling.`,
