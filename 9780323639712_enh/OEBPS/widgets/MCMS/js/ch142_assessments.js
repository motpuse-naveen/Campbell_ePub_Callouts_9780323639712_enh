A survey of urologists who were aware of the American Urological Association (AUA) Best Practice Statement guidelines revealed that 51% were likely to use thromboprophylaxis (odds ratio, 1.4, confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.6). Eighteen percent of urologic oncologists and/or laparoscopic/robotic specialists and 34% of nonurologic oncologists and/or laparoscopic/robotic specialists avoided routine thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing radical cystectomy. The former were more likely to use thromboprophylaxis (<b><i>P</i></b> &lt; .0001) than other respondents. Urologists graduating after the year 2000 used thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients undergoing radical cystectomy more often than did earlier graduates (79.2% vs. 63.4%, <b><i>P</i></b> &lt; .0001). <b>Based on the American College of Surgeons NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) database from 1307 patients who underwent radical cystectomy, the mean time to venous thromboembolism diagnosis was 15.2 days postoperatively; 55% of all venous thromboembolism events were diagnosed after patient discharge home.</b> It is recommended to consider extended duration pharmacologic prophylaxis (4 weeks) in this high-risk surgical population.`,

Recent modifications include early use of alvimopan, intraoperative goal-oriented fluid optimization, immediate initiation of oral diet, and reduced narcotic use. Xu and colleagues (2015) compared traditional pathway to an enhanced recovery protocol and reported decreased opioid usage per day, incidence of ileus, and hospital stay. <b>Opioid use for breakthrough pain underwent a radical change from opioid patient controlled analgesia (PCA) and epidurals to high-dose acetaminophen and/or ketorolac. Patients who underwent RARC with ICUD and participated in the ERAS pathway had shorter length of stay and were more likely to receive a neobladder.</b> The ERAS group was associated with significantly lower overall, gastrointestinal-related complications and readmission rates at 90 days. Participating in the ERAS pathway and younger age were independently associated with a hospital stay of less than 10 day. Pooled meta-analysis of 13 studies with 1493 patients showed that implementation of ERAS protocols after surgery reduced complications, length of stay without impacting overall readmission rates.`,

The <b>nerves are at risk at their origin in the medial aspect of the common iliac vessels and the presacral area.</b> It is critical to keep in mind the course of the pelvic plexus while performing an extended lymph node dissection as it can risk both sexual function and continence. <b>The approach to nerve-sparing has to also start early on from the high ligation of the bladder vascular pedicle</b> (ensuring preservation of the proximal neurovascular complex) to the incision of the peritoneum in the pouch of Douglas overlying the recto-vesical space. Once the ampullae of the vasa are identified and safely dissected an athermal approach of the seminal vesicles, while sparing the Denonvilliers fascia (where the pelvic plexus is mostly concentrated), should be attempted. It is safe to avoid manipulation and sometimes spare the middle to lower part of the seminal vesicles.

        ansText: `Rationale: Several other key steps include mobilizing the sigmoid colon out of the true pelvis, and occasionally a stay suture is used to keep it temporarily fixed laterally until the neobladder is created. It is also critical to reduce the steep Trendelenburg position after undocking the robot. The new advances with the da-Vinci Xi Surgical System with an integrated operating room table will make this easier without undocking the surgical robot. Application of perineal pressure at the time of anastomosis with insertion of Foley catheter to guide the needle towards the urethral opening has already been used consistently during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The utilization of barbed suture, especially the V-Loc, has helped reduce time and complexity of neobladder creation as well as the urethral anastomosis. Detubularization of the ileal segment, opening and stretching of the bowel helps in adding length to the ileum. The peritoneal covering of the ileum can be also incised and the mesenteric fat is released to help add length. This should be performed with care as it exposes the mesenteric vessels and can lead to annoying bleeding which can jeopardize the vascular supply to the neobladder. The Karolinska group has used Penrose drains in their early experience for gentle stretching and traction of bowel for ease of anastomosis.`,
