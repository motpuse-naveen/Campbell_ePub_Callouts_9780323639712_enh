        q: `A 64-year-old man is found to have an 8-cm left renal mass and presents to the office for evaluation regarding laparoscopic radical nephrectomy. He has a history of hypertension, non–insulin-dependent diabetes, and 30-pack-year history of tobacco use, which he quit 10 years ago. He has a strong family history of heart disease (father died at the age of 55 years from a myocardial infarction).

Be started on preoperative β blocker to reduce the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia.</b>--> This choice is best given the patient’s multiple risk factors. Although cardiac stress testing may be considered, <b>the patient’s ability to climb three flights of stairs indicates a capacity of greater than 4 metabolic equivalents (METs) and therefore a low risk of significant coronary artery disease.</b> Although routine preoperative testing is performed widely, there is no evidence that routine testing reduces the risk of perioperative complications.`,

Laparoscopic surgery is the preferred approach in morbidly obese patients secondary to the reduced risk of pulmonary and wound complications. Literature suggests that <b>severely malnourished patients (&gt;20 pounds weight loss in 3 months) significantly benefit from 7 to 10 days of enteral (not parenteral) feedings before elective surgery.</b> The primary determinants of the degree of severity in patients with cirrhosis are hepatic function and severity of clinical manifestations. `,

Recent meta-analyses from the colorectal literature indicate that mechanical bowel preparation does not decrease the risk of postoperative infections. <b>Unless in the presence of active infection, perioperative antibiotics should be stopped 24 hours after incision</b> to decrease the risk of <b><i>Clostridium difficile</i></b> colitis.

Halothane can adversely affect left ventricular function and should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure. Desflurane has a pungent odor and is more suitable for maintenance of anesthesia during prolonged procedures. Intravenous thiopental can increase airway reactivity and is not appropriate in patients with asthma.
