The outer layer of the tunica consists of longitudinally oriented fibers and the inner layer consists of circular fibers. A middle layer of obliquely oriented fibers connects the outer and inner layers. Penile erection does not require presence of valves to restrict blood flow; the emissary veins are compressed between the erectile tissue and the tough fibrous sheath of the tunica.`,

Arterial vasodilation, sinusoid relaxation, increased corporal pressure, and venous occlusion are components of the full erection phase that continue into the rigid erection phase.

Dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin play important roles regulating sexual responses (libido, erection, ejaculation) in the central nervous system.

Upregulation of nNOS is associated with superior erectile function, which is counter to what is observed commonly in diabetic and aged animals. nNOS and eNOS are physiologically important whereas iNOS is activated in the setting of tissue stress. Tyrosine hydroxylase is an enzyme involved in production of catecholamines, which tend to favor sympathetic tone and oppose erectile processes.
