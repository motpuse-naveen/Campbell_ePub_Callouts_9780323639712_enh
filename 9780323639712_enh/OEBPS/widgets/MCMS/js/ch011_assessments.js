Various catheters or kits can be used to place a catheter over the wire. The Lowsley retractor is a modified male urethral sound that can be used to place a suprapubic catheter. There are trocars that can be placed under vision with a cystoscope that can accommodate a catheter once the inner section is removed and the sheath left in place.`,
