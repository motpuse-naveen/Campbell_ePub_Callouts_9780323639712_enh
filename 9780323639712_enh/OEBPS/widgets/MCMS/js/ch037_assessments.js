Children with bladder and sphincteric dysfunction are the most complex reconstructive cases seen in pediatric urology; children with the diagnoses of exstrophy, persistent cloaca and urogenital sinus, posterior urethral valves, bilateral single ectopic ureters, and prune-belly syndrome may be involved.

The effective use of CIC has allowed the application of augmentation and lower tract reconstruction to groups of patients who had not previously been candidates. The principle of intermittent catheterization allows the reconstructive surgeon to aggressively correct storage problems by providing an adequate reservoir and good outflow resistance. Spontaneous voiding, although a goal, is not imperative because catheterization can be used for emptying. `,

    ansText: `Rationale: Multiple factors contribute to the property of compliance. Initially the bladder is in a collapsed state, which allows for the storage of urine at low pressure by simply unfolding. While it expands, detrusor properties of elasticity and viscoelasticity take effect. Elasticity allows the detrusor muscle to stretch without an increase in tension until it reaches a critical volume. When filling is slow, as in a natural state, or stops, there is a rapid decay in this pressure known as stress relaxation. Normally, stress relaxation is in balance with the filling rate and prevents an increase in detrusor pressure. `,

All patients should be warned of this potential problem, although in most patients these symptoms are intermittent and mild and do not require treatment. The dysuria is less problematic in patients with limited sensation due to neurogenic dysfunction. Patients who are incontinent or have decreased renal function may be at increased risk. These problems occur less frequently after antral gastric cystoplasty in which there is a smaller load of parietal cells. `,
