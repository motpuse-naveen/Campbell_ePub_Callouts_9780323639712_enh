This prenatal US with 8-mm anteroposterior diameter of renal pelvic diameter (APRPD) in the third trimester would represent low risk, or A1 disease. UPJ obstruction is the second most common cause of UTD. VUR accounts for 10% to 20% UTD and other causes account for less than 10% of UTD. A postnatal US after 48 hours of age is recommended. `,

Up to 28% of UTD may be detected after initial negative US. An informed discussion should be performed with the family to discuss therapeutic options. VCUG should not be performed as the risk of UTI from reflux is currently low in the absence of dilation in a circumcised boy.

Guidelines suggest that VCUG should be performed at the discretion of the clinician but should not universally be applied. UPJ obstruction is unlikely with low-risk upper tract dilation. Prophylactic antibiotics and additional imaging studies such as VCUG and MAG3 scans should be reserved for those patients who are at the highest risk of infection, which includes females, uncircumcised males, high-grade dilation (SFU [Society of Fetal Urology] grades 3–4), and ureteral dilation. `,

    ansText: `Rationale: VCUG is recommended for any patient with P3 UTD or high risk. P2 and P3 risk categories both include an APRPD greater than or equal to 15 mm, peripheral calyceal dilation, or ureteral abnormality. P2 patients may undergo VCUG at discretion of the clinician. P3 or high risk is distinguished by any abnormality of renal parenchymal thickness, renal parenchymal appearance, or abnormality of the bladder. Therefore a patient with P3 UTD or high risk should undergo a follow-up US at 1 month and a VCUG and should be started on prophylactic antibiotics. Renal scintigraphy can be performed at the clinician’s discretion. VCUG can be performed on an outpatient basis. VUR will be present in up to 31% of patients screened with UTD, will occur more commonly in males, and will be high grade and bilateral. Upper tract dilation correlates poorly with presence of VUR. One-quarter of patients with VUR on postnatal VCUG will have no dilation on a postnatal US.`,

    ansText: `Rationale: Sussman et al. reported that indications for surgery in an otherwise asymptomatic patient include decreased split differential function, delayed drainage, or significant retention on delayed upright imaging. A limitation of a MAG3 renal scan is that it does not provide high-resolution imaging of the genitourinary (GU) system. The best imaging modality to assess the insertion point of an ectopic ureter would be magnetic resonance (MR) urogram. MAG3 is not filtered through the glomerulus. Rather, it is handled by the proximal tubule and therefore is not an accurate measure of GFR. Dehydration of the patient may affect the results of a MAG3 scan. Administration of Lasix should be individualized for each patient at the height of tracer uptake within the collecting system. `,

    answer: [4],
    ansText: `Rationale: An acute postnatal change in scrotal examination suggests a postnatal torsion. Up to 44% of postnatal torsion can be salvaged with emergent exploration and septopexy. In prenatal torsion, the postnatal exam will not change from birth. The testis will be a solid, nontender mass and demonstrate absence of flow on Doppler US. The affected testis is not salvageable in prenatal torsion. Most pediatric urologists would perform contralateral septopexy on an urgent basis in patients with a diagnosis of prenatal torsion to prevent asynchronous contralateral torsion. Scrotal US with Doppler may have a role if the diagnosis is unclear, but surgical exploration should not be delayed if the clinician has made a diagnosis of postnatal torsion. Serial scrotal examinations are not warranted, because postnatal torsion can be diagnosed clinically and should be addressed as a surgical emergency. Likewise, there is no role for antibiotics, because this clinical picture is not consistent with an infectious process. `,
