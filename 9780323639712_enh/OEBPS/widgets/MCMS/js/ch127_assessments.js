This was subsequently attributed to the high pressure necessary to inject the viscous material with large particles, resulting in material displacement into vascular or lymphatic spaces.

    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [2],
    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>c. With vesicoureteral reflux.</b>--> The Credé maneuver (manual compression of the bladder) is most effective in patients with decreased bladder tone who can generate an intravesical pressure greater than 50 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and have decreased bladder outlet resistance. The Credé maneuver requires good hand control, is easier in a thin individual than an obese one, and is more easily performed in a child than in an adult. Voiding by Credé is unphysiologic, because active opening of the bladder neck does not occur, and increases in outlet resistance by a reflex mechanism may actually occur. If complete emptying does not occur, treatment to decrease outlet resistance can be contemplated, or an alternative method to empty the bladder should be used. Vesicoureteral reflux is a relative contraindication to external compression and straining maneuvers, especially in patients capable of generating a high intravesical pressure.`,

      `Complete closure of the bladder neck is rarely necessary.`,
      `The main indication is urethral destruction after prolonged catheter drainage.`,

      `The transvaginal approach has decreased the postoperative fistula rate.`,
    ],
    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [4],
    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>e. The transvaginal approach has decreased the postoperative fistula rate.</b>--> Complete closure of the bladder neck is rarely necessary, because a compressive bladder neck sling is more easily performed, is less morbid, and allows transurethral access if necessary. The main indication for bladder outlet closure is urethral destruction secondary to prolonged catheter drainage in neurogenic bladder patients. A case series using “tight” autologous pubovaginal sling and lower urinary tract reconstruction for urethras destroyed by long-term Foley catheter use reported excellent results with minimal incontinence. The authors concluded that at least 1 cm of normal urethra was required for proper functioning of the sling. The risk of complications, specifically a vesicovaginal fistula, is relatively common and can be difficult to repair. It is important to remember that a bladder neck closure is much more difficult than a simple closure of the bladder wall. The bladder neck is usually hyperactive in patients with neurologic disease, and every voiding reflex includes active opening and closing of the bladder neck, which forcibly attempts to destroy the bladder neck closure. To reduce this risk, postoperative suppression of the voiding reflex using prolonged continuous catheter drainage (3 weeks) and liberal use of anticholinergics is imperative. In addition, to reduce the risk of fistula, the repair must be watertight from the beginning, and this requires a precise mucosal closure using a running suture and multiple additional layers of muscle to reinforce the strength of the repair.`,

      `Trigger voiding can be induced by squeezing the clitoris.`,
    ],
    optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
    answer: [3],
    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>d. Trigger voiding induces a reflex decrease in outlet resistance in patients with sphincter dyssynergia.</b>--> In some types of spinal cord injury or bladder dysfunction characterized by detrusor hyperreflexia, manual pressure may sometimes be used to initiate a reflexive bladder contraction—sometimes called “trigger voiding.” The most effective method of initiating a reflex contraction is thought to be rhythmic suprapubic manual pressure, typically seven or eight compressions every 3 seconds. This rhythmic pressure is thought to produce a summation effect on the tension receptors in the bladder wall, resulting in an afferent neural discharge that activates the bladder reflex arc. Trigger voiding can also sometimes be induced by pulling the skin or hair of the pubis, scrotum, or thigh; squeezing the clitoris; or digital rectal stimulation. Surgical procedures to reduce outlet resistance should be considered, if significant obstruction or sphincter dyssynergia are present. In an animal model using neural rerouting, a detrusor contraction without striated sphincter dyssynergia could be initiated by scratching the skin or by percutaneous electrical stimulation in the L7 dermatome. The pathway was found to be mediated by cholinergic transmission at both ganglionic and peripheral levels. The importance of this experimental model is that somatic motor axons were able to innervate parasympathetic bladder ganglion cells and therefore transfer somatic reflex activity to the lower urinary tract.`,

Regardless of the etiology, it is clinically heralded by the development of poor detrusor compliance demonstrated on urodynamic studies.`,
