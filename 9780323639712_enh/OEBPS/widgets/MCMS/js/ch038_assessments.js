        ansText: `Rationale: The finding of a 3-mm golden-yellow nodule is indicative of ectopic adrenal. The adrenal develops just medial to the gonadal ridge. Their close proximity explains their location along the spermatic cord and their incidental identification at the time of herniorrhaphy or orchidopexy. Histologically, the nodules contain adrenal cortex but no medulla. In this case, the absent vas should raise a red flag for possible ipsilateral renal agenesis because the ureteral bud and vas are both derived from the wolffian duct. <b>In one study, 79% of adult males with absence of the vas deferens have an absent ipsilateral kidney, with left-sided lesions predominating.</b> The lower pole and mid-pole of the epididymis are wolffian duct derivatives. The head of the epididymis is derived from the mesonephric tubules, which link the mesonephric or wolffian duct with the gonad. `,
