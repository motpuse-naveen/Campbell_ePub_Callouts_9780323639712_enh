    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>d. Occult incontinence may not be adequately addressed.</b>--> Midurethral slings performed at the time of prolapse surgery have now been shown to be safe and efficacious; however, appropriate MUS tensioning in women with occult SUI (only seen with POP reduction) may be challenging. Risks of perforation, exposure, and infection are no greater than when the midurethral sling is performed as a primary isolated procedure. Concomitant hysterectomy has been shown not to have an adverse effect on continence status associated with these procedures. In addition, rates of postoperative urethrolysis are no greater when the midurethral sling technology is combined with a prolapse correction. Rates of retention are also not appreciably higher in this population, compared with those women undergoing isolated slings only.`,

    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>e. Single-incision sling manufacturers are required to perform 522 postmarket surveillance studies.</b>--> In January 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated that all manufacturers of synthetic prosthetic mesh and biologic graft materials marketed for pelvic organ prolapse repair and single-incision sling products perform 522 postmarket surveillance studies. Midurethral sling products (except single-incision slings) were excluded from this mandate because, in September 2011, an FDA advisory panel<sup>a</sup> deemed existing midurethral sling products “safe and effective.”`,

    ansText: `Rationale: <!--<b>c. Surgical mesh for transvaginal prolapse.</b>--> On January 4, 2016, the FDA issued one order to reclassify mesh used for transvaginal prolapse repair from class II device, which generally includes moderate-risk devices, to class III, which includes high-risk devices.<sup>a</sup> A second order requires manufacturers to submit a PMA application to support the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal POP repair. The PMA pathway will require manufacturers to address safety concerns, including severe pelvic pain and organ perforation, to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. These orders do not apply to surgical mesh used for other indications, such as full-length MUS and mesh for sacral colpopexy, and remain class II devices. Single-incision mini-slings are currently undergoing 522 postmarket surveillance order studies.`,
