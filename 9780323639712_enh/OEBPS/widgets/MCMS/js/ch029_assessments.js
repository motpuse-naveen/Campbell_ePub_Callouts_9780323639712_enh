        ansText: `Rationale: Approximately 10% of children undergoing antireflux surgery have an element of ureteral duplication. The most common configuration is a complete duplication that results in two separate orifices. This is best managed by preserving a cuff of bladder mucosa that encompasses both orifices. Because the pair typically share blood supply along their adjoining wall, mobilization as one unit with a “common sheath” preserves vascularity and minimizes trauma. `,

Laparoscopic reimplantation requires a team with at least two surgeons; the repair is converted from an extraperitoneal to an intraperitoneal approach; operative time is longer than with open techniques (although with experience it is now becoming gradually shorter); and cost is increased because of lengthier surgery and the expense of disposable equipment. `,
