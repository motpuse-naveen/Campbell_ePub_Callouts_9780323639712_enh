If the testis is unable to be well palpated in the scrotum, then orchiectomy is indicated. Some advocate early orchiectomy of any undescended testis in MGD because tumors have been reported in children younger than 5 years of age.

Although not always accurate, the US features of this tumor are suggestive of teratoma. AFP levels do not reach normal adult levels until close to 1 year of life therefore this elevation is not necessarily reflective of a continued yolk sac tumor.
