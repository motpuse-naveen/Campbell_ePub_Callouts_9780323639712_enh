        ansText: `Rationale: Bilateral hydronephrosis with a distended bladder is usually well tolerated and does not represent a definitely obstructed urinary tract. Therefore, no antenatal intervention is necessary. The presence of isolated urinary ascites or pulmonary hypoplasia also does not warrant drainage of the fetal bladder. Nevertheless, the association of those findings with a progressively decreased amniotic fluid most probably represents an obstructed bladder due to an atretic urethra associated with functioning kidneys, which can be treated by bladder decompression. `,

        optionStyleType: `st-lower-alpha`,
        answer: [3],
        ansText: `Rationale: In prune-belly syndrome, the kidneys may present variable degrees of renal dysplasia, with substitution of the normal parenchyma by cystic structures. This may affect one or both kidneys, in a pattern that is not proportional to the patient’s abdominal flaccidity, the degree of dilatation of the urinary tract, or the presence of vesicoureteral reflux. When bilateral dysplasia occurs, survival is compromised. Hydroureteronephrosis is also variable, but in general does not impact in the initial renal function. Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in two-thirds of the patients, eventually associated with more dilated lower ureteral segments. Urachal diverticulum is present frequently, usually with thick musculo-fibrotic walls. In more rare cases, associated with an atretic urethra, the urachus can be completely patent to the umbilicus, in this case functioning as an efficient bladder drainage that helps preserve the upper urinary tract function. The posterior urethra is dilated, but contrary to patients with posterior urethral valves, the bladder neck is wide open, making it difficult to characterize the transition between the posterior urethra and the base of the bladder. `,

        ansText: `Rationale: The abdominal flaccidity is the hallmark of the syndrome. It affects unevenly the medial and inferior segments of the abdomen, but in some patients the lateral aspects are more compromised. The musculo-aponeurotic layer of the abdominal wall is very deficient, with a very thin layer of muscle cells interwoven with aponeurotic tissue that hardly exert any contraction and support to respiration, therefore impairing pulmonary function. The lack of adequate abdominal muscular anchoring and support is responsible for the cases that present with pectus carinatum or scavatum. The lack of intra-abdominal pressure due to the weakness of the abdominal wall musculature is one of the causes of abdominal cryptorchidism. Despite eventually described intestinal abnormalities, obstruction doesn’t occur primarily, being reported as a complication of intraperitoneal surgical procedures. `,

Sometimes the ureteral folds at this segment may also cause significant difficulty to the drainage of the renal pelvis.

As in all children with abdominal undescended testes, the orchidopexy can be successfully carried out without the Fowler-Stephens technique before the second year of age. In adult patients who underwent early successful orchidopexy, the hormonal function is normally preserved, with no need of hormonal supplementation.
