Platelet transfusion for a 78-year-old male with chronic renal insufficiency who was scheduled to undergo partial nephrectomy and found to have a platelet count of 55,000 on preoperative testing.</b>--> This patient has moderate thrombocytopenia with likely platelet dysfunction secondary to uremia undergoing a high-bleeding-risk procedure; therefore platelet transfusion is indicated. Current indications for packed red blood cell transfusion are maintenance of hematocrit of greater than 30% in patients with high risk of myocardial ischemia or in patients with hematocrit 21% to 30% with signs of inadequate oxygen-carrying capacity. Fresh frozen plasma transfusion is indicated only in the presence of active bleeding rather than isolated INR elevation or large-volume transfusion.`,

Be maintained with core body temperature between 36°C and 38°C throughout the perioperative period.</b>--> Hypothermia by as little as 1°C has been shown to increase surgical site infection and postoperative complications. There is no evidence that showering with an antiseptic solution the night before surgery decreases the incidence of wound infection. Fixed shoulder braces have been associated with an increased risk of brachial plexus injury and should not be used in the operating room. Both legs should be positioned simultaneously when placing patients in the dorsal lithotomy position. Everyone in the operating room is responsible for patient safety, and therefore the surgeon should always be present for patient positioning.`,

        answer: [4],
        ansText:`Rationale: <!--<b>e. Polydioxanone suture (PDS) with continuous closure.</b>--> Continuous closure with PDS (slowly absorbable) suture has been shown to have the lowest wound failure rates. In the presence of infection, braided sutures (silk and Vicryl) should be avoided to prevent secondary wound infection and failure. Although nonabsorbable sutures may be used, these have been associated with increased postoperative patient discomfort. Fast-absorbing sutures (such as Dexon) should not be used in continuous fascial closure because of increased wound failure risks.`,

Pad the lateral knee to avoid excessive compression against the stirrups.</b>--> Numerous injuries leading to neuropathy can occur during prolonged surgery in the Trendelenburg position. Of particular concern is injury to the brachial plexus from improper shoulder positioning, radial nerve injury from prolonged pressure on the radial nerve, and lower extremity nerve injuries from improper positioning in lithotomy stirrups. In general, the hips should be flexed at 80 to 100 degrees with 30- to 45-degree abduction. Tightly wrapping the patient’s arms at his or her side imposes the risk of injury to the radial nerve. Only loosely securing the patient’s shoulders to the table may prevent brachial plexus injuries, but it also puts the patient at risk of a fall off the table during the course of the procedure.`,
